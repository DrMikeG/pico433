When capacitors are connected across each other (side by side) this is called a parallel connection.
To calculate the total overall capacitance of a number of capacitors connected in this way you add up the individual capacitances using the following formula:
 CTotal = C1 + C2

 There is a 22nF in situ at C1

 Higher value C1 increased sensitivity, but more power and slower reaction time.
 Value should be in the 2-50nF range.

 Adding a second 22nF would give 44nF

 I think they are 0603 packaged
